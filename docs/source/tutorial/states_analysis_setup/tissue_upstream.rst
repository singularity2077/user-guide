Tissue Sample Upstream Analysis
===============================

The upstream analysis for tissue samples is located in the ``tissue_upstream`` folder.

Workflow
--------
The workflow for tissue samples follows a similar process as the cell line analysis, adapted for the complexities of tissue material. This typically includes:

*   Registration
*   Spotfinding
*   Decoding
*   Segmentation
*   Stitching
*   Assignment

Key Considerations
------------------
Analysis of tissue samples may require adjustments to parameters and potentially additional pre-processing steps compared to cell lines due to tissue heterogeneity and autofluorescence.

.. note::
   For more details, refer to the specific subdirectories and corresponding scripts in the ``tissue_upstream`` folder.
