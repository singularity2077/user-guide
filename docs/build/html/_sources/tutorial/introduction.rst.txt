Overview of the Projects
------------------------

This User Guide covers two interconnected projects: the STATES analysis pipeline and an Image Processing Automation System.

STATES Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project consists of analyses in STATES (Spatially-resolved transcriptomics and translatomics employed simultaneously). It focuses on upstream processing for both cell lines and tissue samples, involving steps like registration, spotfinding, decoding, segmentation, stitching, and assignment.

Image Processing Automation System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a system for automating image processing workflows, primarily designed for managing and executing a series of image processing steps, including registration and stitching. The system is built to leverage the SLURM job scheduling system, supporting parallel processing and batch task management.
